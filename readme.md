Clash of Clans - Determine Battle Winner

Clash of clans is a popular android/iOS game which is lightly based on Age of Empires.
In Clash of clans, the player is chief of a village which has defensive buildings and can train army to attack other villages.
When an army attacks a village, the army attacks the defensive buildings and tries to destroy all of them while the defensive buildings try to kill all the troops in the army.
